# German VerbCon Trainer

## Origin Story
Project originally made somewhere between 2015 and 2017.
One of my fellow tutors requested an app, which could be used for practicing verb conjugation.
It didn't have to work perfectly, it didn't need to be perfect. It just needed to be - ASAP.
That project was one of my first actual projects, which actually does something useful.
I decided to upload it after all these years and (at least partly) correct programming and English mistakes.

## Licence
I chose MIT license, so feel free to modify, find bugs, propose features and even use it (for yourself or as a teaching tool, I don't mind :D).
