# German VerbCon Trainer

## Origin Story
Project originally made somewhere between 2015 and 2017.
One of my fellow tutors requested an app, which could be used for practicing verb conjugation.
It didn't have to work perfectly, it didn't need to be perfect. It just needed to be - ASAP.
That project was one of my first actual projects, which actually does something useful.
I decided to upload it after all these years and (at least partly) correct programming and English mistakes.

## Installation
- If the newest release is available, just download it and run it!
- If the release is not available, you need to compile the project yourself. Download the project, open it (file: GERMAN VerbCon Trainer.sln) using Visual Studio 2019 (or newer) and press Build Solution (shortcut: Ctrl + Shift + B). If there are no errors, you'll find:

  Trainer in *..\Main App\GermanVerbsConjugationTrainer\bin\Debug* or *..\bin\Release*

  Editor  in *..\Verb Editor\TrainerVerbsEditor\bin\Debug* or *..\bin\Release*

## Usage
- Use Trainer app to practice verbs. Input a word, press Next, choose correct answers. After that, check or show the answers using the buttons.

## Features
(VT = Verb Trainer, TE = Trainer Editor)
- VT automatically prepares conjugation for regular verbs
- VT checks given answers and allows to display correct ones
- TE allows to add custom (irregular) verbs with their conjugation
- TE has easy shortcut system. You can move around using arrows and press enter to add/modify verb.

## Coming Soon
- Full list of irregular verbs (there will be no need to add them yourself)
- Option to pick random irregular verb to practice
- Some system of highscore, points or something (e.g. exam like, answer most of questions correctly)

## Licence
I chose MIT license, so feel free to modify, find bugs, propose features and even use it (for yourself or as a teaching tool, I don't mind :D).
